Feedback Received:

The major critical feedbacks that we received from the individual team members of the reviewing team are as below:

Vipin Jose:

1: The overview visualization doesn't seem to be specific to the target audience and improving the same might help in getting better insights from the visualization.

2: Having a color scale in map (heat map) instead of bar chart, as bar chart might make the map look messy.

Srinivas Ganeshan:

3: Customer might want to check the performance of an individual company. So, adding a filter on companies to highlight states and see how the company is performing can be very helpful.

4: Customers would like to compare the performance of 2 companies.

5: Moving between the views instead of having everything on a single page.


Analysis:

For each of the feedbacks as numbered above, below is our analysis and decision, considering all the factors such as team strength, time availability and skill levels.

1. Our target audience for the project were the Consumers as well as the Corporate Management team. However, since having an generalized overview might make the visualization unintuitive, we will focus from the perspective of Consumers.

2. To this point, we might implement our approach first and decide based on the output that we are able to achieve.

3. While we feel that this feature is good to have. We have a constraint on the number of people and according to our current view interactions, this might be complex. So, we will give it a try only if time permits.

4. This again is a good to have feature, however, we will not be able to implement this as of now due to the limitation of time.

5. We thought about this point and finally decided that having multiple tabs for overview and details won't solve the problem as we will have to switch between tabs. So, we plan to implement one-page scroll type website to make the transitions better.
